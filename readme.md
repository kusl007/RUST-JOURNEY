Rust Journey 🚀
Welcome to my Rust Journey repository! This repo documents my learning experience with the Rust programming language, following along with the Rust playlist by Piyush Garg on YouTube and the official Rust documentation.

🦀 Why Rust?
Rust is known for:

Memory safety without garbage collection.
Great performance and low-level control.
A growing ecosystem and strong community support.
I decided to learn Rust to build more reliable and efficient systems programming projects and improve my understanding of how memory works.
