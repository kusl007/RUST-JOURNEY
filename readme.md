# Rust Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Rust Journey** repository! This repo documents my learning experience with the Rust programming language, following along with the [Rust playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unRhxbFULII&list=PLinedj3B30sA_M0oxCRgFzPzEMX3CSfT5) by **Piyush Garg** on YouTube.

## 📚 Playlist Link
I am learning Rust from the amazing YouTube playlist by **Piyush Garg**. You can check out the playlist here: [Rust Programming Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unRhxbFULII&list=PLinedj3B30sA_M0oxCRgFzPzEMX3CSfT5).

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This repository will include:
- Code snippets from the playlist.
- Exercises and solutions.
- Personal notes and comments.
- Additional resources related to Rust.



## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust is known for:
- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- Great performance and low-level control.
- A growing ecosystem and strong community support.

I decided to learn Rust to build more reliable and efficient systems programming projects and improve my understanding of how memory works.
