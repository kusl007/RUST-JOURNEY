# Rust Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Rust Journey** repository! This repo documents my learning experience with the Rust programming language, following along with the [Rust playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unRhxbFULII&list=PLinedj3B30sA_M0oxCRgFzPzEMX3CSfT5) by **Piyush Garg** on YouTube and the official Rust documentation.

## 📚 Resources
- [Rust Programming Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unRhxbFULII&list=PLinedj3B30sA_M0oxCRgFzPzEMX3CSfT5) by **Piyush Garg** on YouTube.
- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) – the official guide to learning Rust.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This repository will include:
- Code snippets from the playlist and official Rust documentation.
- Exercises and solutions.
- Personal notes and comments.
- Additional resources related to Rust.

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust is known for:
- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- Great performance and low-level control.
- A growing ecosystem and strong community support.

I decided to learn Rust to build more reliable and efficient systems programming projects and improve my understanding of how memory works.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kusl007/RUST-JOURNEY.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-journey
   ```
3. Compile and run the Rust code:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## 📘 Documentation

- For more in-depth understanding of Rust, I am also referring to the official Rust documentation: [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).
